# Organizer_for_Music_Teachers
This is an application I created in grade 12 (2021) during high school for the I.B. Internal Assessment of my HL Computer Science class. Students were tasked with creating an application to solve any problem, given that a suitable advisor could be involved in the problem design and testing of the app. We were also required to document the working process and record a short video, demonstrating the app's functionalities.

The purpose of my app was to help private music teachers with planning, tracking, and organizing information about their students and lessons. I worked with my old violin teacher to model what functionalities the app might include, and these discussions concluded with this final flowchart:

The finished product consisted of these ?? parts:

## Registration & Login
Users can create a new account and log into the application. Error-handling is implemented for both sign-up and login.

## Calendar Display
Users can view accurate calendar dates and save/display important events. Events have descriptions, times, and reoccurrences associated with them.

## Student Lists
Users can view and sort a master list of all their students. This list is editable, allowing users to add new students and delete old ones.

## Student Records
Users can view, edit, and save information about students here, such as contact info, musical repertoire, planned lesson dates and times, as well as additional comments/notes. Users can also sort the students' information by first/last name, and they can also search for a specific student.

## Financial Records
Users can save information about student payment plans here (frequency, amount, next scheduled payment, additional notes). Sorting and searching functionality, based on student name, is also implemented in this section, and small calculator is also built into this part.

## Notepad
Users can type notes here that will save upon signing out.

## Help Pop-up
Users can view section-specific help messages by clicking this button, and they can also see general instructions in the homepage upon sign-in.

## Sign-out
Users can log out of their account with all of their information stored.

I started this project mid-February of 2021 and submitted it early-April, 2021.
