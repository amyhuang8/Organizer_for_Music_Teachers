# Organizer for Music Teachers
## Introduction:
This is an application I created in high school (grade 12, 2021) for the I.B. Internal Assessment of my HL Computer Science class.

Students were tasked with creating an application to solve any problem, given that a suitable advisor could be involved in the problem design and testing of the app. We were also required to document the working process and record a short video, demonstrating the app's functionalities.

The purpose of my app was to help private music teachers with planning, tracking, and organizing information about their students and lessons, and I worked with my old violin teacher to model what functionalities the app might include.

I started this project mid-February of 2021 and submitted it early-April, 2021.

## Design:
I created this flowchart and based my app design on it:

## Functionality:
The finished product consisted of these 8 parts:

**Registration & Login:**
Users can create a new account and log into the application. Error-handling is implemented for both sign-up and login.

**Calendar Display:**
Users can view accurate calendar dates and save/display important events. Events have descriptions, times, and reoccurrences associated with them.

**Student Lists:**
Users can view and sort a master list of all their students. This list is editable, allowing users to add new students and delete old ones.

**Student Records:**
Users can view, edit, and save information about students here, such as contact info, musical repertoire, planned lesson dates and times, as well as additional comments/notes. Users can also sort the students' information by first/last name, and they can also search for a specific student.

**Financial Records:**
Users can save information about student payment plans here (frequency, amount, next scheduled payment, additional notes). Sorting and searching functionality, based on student name, is also implemented in this section, and small calculator is also built into this part.

**Notepad:**
Users can type notes here that will save upon signing out.

**Help Pop-ups:**
Users can view section-specific help messages by clicking this button, and they can also see general instructions in the homepage upon signing in.

**Sign-out:**
Users can log out of their account with all of their information stored.
